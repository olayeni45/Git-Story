Synopsis of Pull requests and merge
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. 
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up
commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull
request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible
in the "Files changed" tab.

Creating a pull request
Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch,
which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work.
